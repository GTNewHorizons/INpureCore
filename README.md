==========

INPure Core - Useful for NEI culling.  Maintained by the GTNH Team.  Originally by denoflionsx 


The original repository has been removed, There appears to be a few forks around but it wasn't clear which version exactly they were on so this is the
result of a decompilation of 1.0.0B9-62.
